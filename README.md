# Babalang

Babalang is an object-oriented, Turing-complete esoteric programming language inspired by the rule 
system within the (also Turing-complete) indie game Baba Is You. The language is based around statements 
(akin to rules in Baba Is You), each with a subject, verb, one or more targets, and an optional condition. 
The language supports variables, loops, functions, structs, and basic IO operations. 

A full language specification is available at the respective [esolangs.org page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Babalang).
